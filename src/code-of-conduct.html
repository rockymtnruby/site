<h4 class="mb-3 text-xl font-bold text-dark">The Quick Version</h4>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference is a harassment-free experience for everyone,
  regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
  body size, race, or religion. We <strong>do not</strong> tolerate harassment
  of conference participants in any form, even if you think you’re just ‘being
  funny’.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
  including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Anyone
  violating these rules may be expelled from the conference
  <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the conference organisers.
  <em>Just don’t do it.</em>
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  If you have any questions, email the organiser at
  <a href="mailto:spike@rockymtnruby.dev" class="text-primary hover:text-dark"
    >spike@rockymtnruby.dev</a
  >
</p>

<h4 class="mb-3 text-xl font-bold text-dark">The Less Quick Version</h4>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
  harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
  events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
  immediately.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
  sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
  Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
  clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may
  take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
  expulsion from the conference with no refund.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
  any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
  Conference staff can be identified as they’ll be wearing branded t-shirts.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
  security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
  experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
  value your attendance.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues
  and conference-related social events.
</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed" data-wow-delay=".1s">
  We also reserve the right to refuse tickets and admission to anyone, for any
  reason. Rocky Mountain Ruby is a privately run event.
