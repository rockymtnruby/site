- title: Modularizing Rails Monoliths One Bite at a Time
  description: >-
    As Rails monoliths grow, coupling becomes increasingly difficult to
    manage. Many have reached for hope in microservices but instead found higher
    complexity. The Modular Monolith approach is a proven, lightweight
    alternative that offers the benefits of enforced boundaries without being
    cumbersome. This talk proposes a phased approach to refactoring toward this
    style using the packwerk gem.

- title: Turbo Frames Explored... for Fun and Profit
  description: >-
    The ‘new magic’ came at the end of 2020: ✨Hotwire⚡️: Stimulus, Turbo
    Streams, Strada, Turbo Drive, and Turbo Frames. Each extremely capable and
    powerful in its own right, but with a wide spread of functions and some
    overlaps, it can be tough to see what’s what. Let’s explore just one avenue:
    Turbo Frames. Let’s see what it can _really_ do.

      Greetings! I’m Jon. I’ve been in the software world for about ten years
      and continue to chase performant/efficient code while maximizing
      readability and (hopefully) minimizing bite-yourself-a-few-years-later
      code. Balance is everything! While I am a tinkering engineer, electrical
      enthusiast, digital minimalist, photographer, and reader, I’m looking
      forward to meeting you, dear reader, and finding out who YOU are! I have a
      deep love for long, slow conversations and comfy chairs — let’s find some.

- title: Go Pro with POROs
  description: >-
    Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) are having a moment. Maybe you’ve heard a
    whisper in the corner about the jack-of-all trades Service Object, or a
    glimmering echo of advocacy for non-database-backed domain models? Think
    you’re using them right? Afraid you’re using them wrong? Then this is the
    talk for you! We’re going to explore the wonderful world of “convention plus
    choose-your-own configuration” of Rails codebases and the shining role of
    POROs (with their ride or dies, the Module). Come hear about the diversity
    of design patterns out in the wild so you too can confidently tell your
    coworkers “let’s just use a PORO for that”.

  description: >-
    We’ve always put a lot of effort into performance at DEV
    (https://dev.to/). We want our users to be able to see their content almost
    instantaneously when interacting with our site. In order to do so we’ve
    placed emphasis on caching. We’ve had to ask ourselves questions like what
    are the right things to cache? Which layer in the stack would be best to
    cache it? And how will this affect the overall performance? During this
    presentation, I’d like to show you some of the caching strategies we have in
    place and discuss how they’ve sped up the interactions within our site.

    We’ll talk about going beyond “fat model, skinny controller” and the
    importance of following the Single Responsibility Principle. Several common
    design patterns will be discussed, but the emphasis will be on the
    importance of encapsulating your logic in whatever way you choose that makes
    the code readable and maintainable. Finally, how do you get your team on
    board?

    It’s one thing to build a new application that meets the latest
    accessibility standards, but it’s another thing to update an existing
    application to meet them. In this talk, we’ll share how we’re using
    automated accessibility scanning, preview-driven development, and an
    accessibility-first form builder to make GitHub’s 15-year-old,
    1,400-controller Ruby on Rails monolith accessible.
