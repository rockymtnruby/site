- title: "Evolution of Real-Time and AnyCable Pro"
  description: >-
    When we launched AnyCable Pro at Evil Martians in 2021, our goal was to simplify real-time functionality for all 
    Rails developers while making it commercially successful for our company. We aimed to build what people wanted and 
    saw their priorities shift from GraphQL to Hotwire, from chats to collaboration, and to AI-powered voice apps. 
    Initially focused on performance, we soon tackled WebSocket reliability and developer productivity, culminating 
    in the launch of Managed AnyCable earlier this year. Our journey, fueled by consulting revenue, is not without 
    valuable insights. Let’s reflect on our story, share our learnings, and glimpse into the future of AnyCable and 
    real-time applications.

  description: >-
    Been to a bootcamp but still trying to land that first real job? Perhaps you've landed an apprenticeship or entry-level job but anxious to move up?
    Or perhaps you lead a team and wish you knew how to acclimate junior developers seamlessly into your organization?
    This session is geared for you.
    Bootcamps can be helpful as a place to start, but there's always a gap between a bootcamp skillset and the skills required for a real job as a Ruby developer.
    In this talk, I'll lay out a practical guide to acquiring the skills and knowledge you'll need to get your foot into the industry or reach that next rung on your career ladder.

- title: "Beyond Code: Crafting effective discussions to further technical decision-making"
  description: >-
    Whiteboards. Proof of Concepts. Pairing. Spikes. These are all tools we use every day to have high-level technical 
    conversations about ideas we propose or approaches we think are the “right” way. As someone advances in their career 
    into more experienced levels of software engineering, however, a critical skill becomes how you conduct and lead these 
    conversations. It involves clearly articulating a vision and securing buy-in, while also valuing and integrating 
    the diverse perspectives and feedback from your peers. The goal beyond each individual conversation is to foster 
    an environment where ideas can be exchanged, discussed, enhanced, and decided on. You’ll walk away from this talk 
    with some new, innovative approaches to try out that not only help get your technical ideas across but also solicit 
    additional thoughts and opinions in ways that engage and effectively address different points of view.

- title: Laziness is a Virtue
  description: >-
    We can write Ruby code in any number of styles, but the community has some accepted norms. For example, almost nobody uses 
    `for` loops any more. We've decided that some styles are "better" than others. And we can keep finding "better" styles.

    In this talk, we'll dig into a more functional "lazy" style. Instead of setting up variables ahead of time, we'll call 
    methods as needed. Instead of thinking about how to compute things, we'll think about properties of objects. 
    This style has improved the readability of my code, and it will help you too. testable code.

  description: >-
    Email is a powerful and flexible way to extend the capabilities of your Rails application. It’s a familiar and low 
    friction way for users to interact with your app.

    As much as you may want your users to access your app, they may not need to. Email is a great example of focusing on 
    the problem at hand instead of an over-complicated solution.

    We’ll take a deeper look at Action Mailbox and how to route and process your inbound emails.

  description: >-
    Time-series data is remarkably common, with applications ranging from IoT to finance. Effectively storing, reading, 
    and presenting this time-series data can be as finicky as catching the perfect wave.

    In order to understand the best-practices of time-series data, we’ll follow a surfer’s journey as she attempts to 
    record every wave she’s ever caught. We’ll discover how to structure the time-series data, query for performant access, 
    aggregate data over timespans, and present the data via an API endpoint. Surf’s up!

- title: "Leveling Up Developer Tooling For The Modern Rails & Hotwire Era"
  description: >-
    The evolution of developer experience (DX) tooling has been a game-changer in how we build, debug, and enhance web applications.

    This talk aims to illuminate the path toward enriching the Ruby on Rails ecosystem with advanced DX tools, focusing 
    on the implementation of Language Server Protocols (LSP) for Stimulus and Turbo.

    Drawing inspiration from the rapid advancements in JavaScript tooling, we explore the horizon of possibilities for 
    Rails developers, including how advanced browser extensions and tools specifically designed for the Hotwire ecosystem 
    can level up your developer experience.

  description: >-
    Embark on an exciting journey beyond the conventional boundaries of web development! This talk promises to unravel the mysteries of running Rails directly in your browser, challenging the constraints of ruby.wasm and the framework. We’ll dig into the world of WebAssembly, where threads, networking, and even beloved Nokogiri and SQLite seem out of reach, and we’ll discover how we can extend the horizon and run Rails in the browser.
    As we wrap up, we'll highlight the missing components in the ecosystem required to transition running Rails in the browser from a theoretical concept to a practical reality. Buckle up!

- title: "Building AI agents in Ruby"
  description: >-
    The Coatue AI report is putting AI models at the centerpiece of all modern tech stacks going forward that Application 
    Devs will be using to build on top of. It would not be controversial to say that the Ruby ecosystem lacks in its support
    and adoption of AI, ML and DS libraries. If we’d like to stay relevant in the future, we need to start building the foundations now. 
    We’ll look at what Generative AI is, what kind of applications developers in other communities are building and how Ruby can be 
    used to build similar applications today. We’ll cover Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings and semantic search, 
    prompt engineering, and what the state of art (SOTA) in evaluating LLM output looks like today. We will also cover AI Agents, 
    semi-autonomous general purpose LLM-backed applications, and what they’re capable of today. We'll make a case why Ruby is a great 
    language to build these applications because of its strengths and its incredible ecosystem. After the slides, we'll build an AI Agent in 15 min.
